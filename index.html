    <br> Pepe the Frog was created by American artist and cartoonist Matt Furie in 2005. Its usage as a meme came from his comic
    Boy's Club #1. The progenitor of Boy's Club was a zine Furie made on Microsoft Paint called Playtime, which included
    Pepe as a character.[12] He posted his comic in a series of blog posts on Myspace in 2005.[7][13] In the comic, Pepe
    is seen urinating with his pants pulled down to his ankles and the catchphrase "feels good man" was his rationale.[14][15]
    Furie took those posts down when the printed edition was published in 2006.[7] "My Pepe philosophy is simple: 'Feels
    good man.' It is based on the meaning of the word Pepe: 'To go Pepe'. I find complete joy in physically, emotionally,
    and spiritually serving Pepe and his friends through comics. Each comic is sacred, and the compassion of my readers transcends
    any differences, the pain, and fear of 'feeling good'." –Matt Furie, 2015 interview with The Daily Dot[2] Pepe was used
    in blog posts on Myspace and became an in-joke on Internet forums. In 2008, the page containing Pepe and the catchphrase
    was scanned and uploaded to 4chan's /b/ board, which has been described as the meme's "permanent home".[7] The meme took
    off among 4chan users, who adapted Pepe's face and catchphrase to fit different scenarios and emotions, such as melancholy,
    anger, and surprise.[2] Color was also added; originally a black-and-white line drawing, Pepe became green with brown
    lips, sometimes in a blue shirt.[13][14] "Feels Guy", or "Wojak", originally an unrelated character typically used to
    express melancholy, was eventually often paired with Pepe in user-made comics or images.[15] In 2014, images of Pepe
    were shared on social media by celebrities such as Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.[7][14][16] As Pepe became more widespread,
    4chan users began referring to particularly creative and unique variants of the meme as "rare Pepes". These images, sometimes
    as physical paintings,[17][18] were sold on eBay and posted on Craigslist.[2][7] 4chan users referred to those who used
    the meme outside the website as "normies" (or "normalfags").[7] In 2015, Pepe was #6 on Daily News and Analysis's list
    of the most important memes and the most retweeted meme on Twitter.[19][20] Until September 2018, Social media service
    Gab used a Pepe-like illustration of a frog (named "Gabby") as its logo. The site is popular with the alt-right
